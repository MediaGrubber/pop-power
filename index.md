**ABOUT THE PERSON RUNNING THIS SITE**

HIS NAME = Stephen

HIS AGE = 28

THINGS HE DOES = teaches in the University of Arizona Writing Program in Tucson, AZ; studies in UA's PhD program in Rhetoric, Composition, and the Teaching of English (RCTE); makes movies; draws pictures; rides bikes; drinks beer.

**ABOUT THIS SITE**

This site is devoted to 2 things:

1. Examining how the term/concept "power" circulates in popular discourse (semi-serious stuff!)
2. Curating playfully satirical sendups of academia (self-flagellation! to keep things from getting too serious)

**HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE SECOND THING**

The following formula is an attempt to encapsulate basically all scholarly existential crises:
> As paradigm shifts in X and Y continue to force us to revamp our definitions of A and B, the debates over the appropriate meanings for R will most likely become even more heated—and, perhaps to those outside academic communities, increasingly irrelevant."

^ Based on a sentence from Derek Owens' contribution to _Keywords in Composition Studies_ (Boynton/Cook, 1996), in which X = technology, Y = culture, A = literacy, B = writing, and R = the essay.

**ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SECOND THING**

The following is from Kurt Spellmeyer's “After Theory: From Textuality to Attunement with the World” (_College English_, vol. 58, no. 8, 1996, pp. 893-913):
> Spivak's rhetoric . . . compels its readers to abandon Mahasweta's words in order to wander through the labyrinths of Foucault's, Derrida's, Volosinov's, and Lacan's. And the result is not emancipation but a forced admission on the reader's part that even when these eminent intellects make very little sense indeed, they still somehow think more usefully than the ordinary reader ever could. If there are any 'subalterns' to be found in this particular study, one of them is surely the reader, insofar as Spivak's practice of theory does to that reader what educators do to the people they have stigmatized as 'remedial.' By refashioning the character of 'literacy' itself, the practitioners of theory have learned to transform whole shoals of articulate PhDs into stammering 'illiterates.' (898)

Actually, that's not satirical, it's a direct quote. Sorry. Still hilarious.

**SPECIAL BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK INTO THE COMPOSING THOUGHT PROCESS**

Something I wrote before making this blog:

> My initial plan was to make a Tumblr blog page; I have some experience with that platform. Lately, however, I’ve been remembering that I need to stop compromising my principles so often by, among other things, being so dependent on proprietary corporate software. Basically my whole life is stored on Google Drive, for example. This is a problem. Instead of being so beholden to Tumblr, Google, Adobe, and their ilk, I’d like to find some open-source, non-proprietary software that I can use to host my little blog project.

Then I found GitHub! And here we are.

**CONTRACT GRADING, THAT'S WHAT!**

*I HEREBY PRESENT WITHOUT FURTHER ADO:*

**A LABORIOUS LABOR REFLECTION**

**First: METRICS by which to quantify the labor required to produce this blog post:**

words that appear below: 4,000ish

words that were written and then deleted: unknowable (you don’t want to know)

hours spent: unknowable (way too many)

calories burned: unknowable (not nearly enough)

**Second: the BLOG POST itself:**

What gets you out of bed in the morning? The smell of percolating coffee? The whine of your bladder-bloated labradoodle? Morning UV rays refracted through the bedroom window, warming your cheek and eyelids?

For my middle-school self, none of these quite did the trick: I had a pathetically hard time getting up when I was supposed to. This of course created problems for my mom, who drove my sister and me to school (where my mom also taught), and for my dad, who also had a job to get to and didn’t have a ton of time to waste, either, trying to coax me out from under the quilt. He thus had no choice but to employ the following wake-up tactics: lights switched on, covers torn back (like a magician’s reveal: incredible! there’s a boy under there!), and, to top it off, a spray bottle filled with cold water. This last one wasn’t exactly the extrinsic motivator I wanted, but it was the one I needed (and also, yes, the one I probably deserved).

Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that graduate school is basically just one big extrinsic motivator: one big squirt bottle filled with ice water.

Maybe that sounds like a bad thing. On the contrary, it’s what gives the work I do meaning and purpose. Without peers and professors to serve as critics and sounding boards, my writing would be totally readerless, totally self-indulgent. It’s only real role would be to take up precious storage space on Google Drive, where it would be mined for data advertisers might be willing to pay for.

Before the fall 2019 semester, I’d never spent much time reflecting on the nature of motivation — the different kinds, whether or not some kinds are better than others, etc. I’d like to take this opportunity to do that, for two reasons. One reason is that I’ve been teaching for a few years, and still often feel dissatisfied with traditional grading regimes, traditional ways of motivating students. I often think: Hm, wish there was a better way, oh well. The second reason is that I’ve heard others claim to have found a better way — something called “contract grading.” Not only that, I’m nearing the end of a graduate course (English 597: Research Methods in Rhetoric & Composition) whose instructor uses contract grading — “labor-based” contract grading, specifically. So: just thought it might be fun, and possibly instructive, to try wrestle a little with some of this assessment model’s apparent assumptions and possible implications.

First, though, I should say that my intent is for this reflection to be about contract grading in general, as opposed to being a reflection on, or critique of, E597’s particular implementation of the grading scheme. Inevitably, I’ll need to draw on some course particulars to illustrate some of what I talk about. But my intent is simply for these examples to help concretize broader concerns.

So. Labor-based contract grading. I’ll admit it takes some getting used to. In some ways, of course, it’s easy to disparage as simply an “A-for-effort” (or “B-for-effort,” or whatever the default grade happens to be) assessment model that values work quantity over work quality.

Of course, it’s not quite that simple. There’s definitely plenty of scholarship underpinning the range of contract grading approaches, which have been around for awhile. Lately, however, they seem to be gaining traction in higher ed. In fact, it wouldn’t be a stretch, I don’t think, to say they’re kind of “in vogue.” Consider, for example, the following:


Jane Danielewicz and Peter Elbow (2008):
[“A Unilateral Grading Contract to Improve Learning and Teaching”](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=eng_faculty_pubs)

Ira Shor (2009):
[“Critical Pedagogy Is Too Big Too Fail”](https://www.goucher.edu/learn/academic-centers/hispanic-and-latinx-studies/documents/Shor.pdf)

Asao Inoue (2019):
[_Labor-Based Grading Contracts: Building Equity and Inclusion in the Compassionate Writing Classroom_](https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/books/labor/contracts.pdf)


I certainly don’t want to ignore or dismiss this work. Just thought I’d offer a street-level view of how some of the norms and expectations created by a labor-based contract-grading scheme have been negotiated, with varying degrees of success, by one particular grad student, meaning me.

As a student who’s also an instructor (I teach first-year composition), I sympathize with the impulse to chuck outmoded, ineffective, reductive, counterproductive, and, in many ways, arbitrary and subjective assessment models.

At the same time, whether we like it or not, most of our students have been conditioned, over the course of basically their whole lives, to think about assessment in certain terms, even to equate aspects of their academic and personal identities with the grades they typically receive. (A student of mine once wrote this about himself: "I have always been a C writer ... Whether that means I've been improving or not I am not sure... but at least I am consistent.") This doesn’t mean instructors should simply bow to the status quo rather than actively resist these conditioning practices and the expectations they perpetuate. But . . . how much power do individual instructors really have to recalibrate these expectations? Especially when those expectations continue to be enforced across the rest of the college curriculum, it can feel like a losing battle. (Especially at the University of Arizona, where I teach and study, where plus and minus letter grades don’t exist, only further locking instructors into unjustifiably rigid, faux-scientific assessment schemes.)

Given that contract grading isn’t so much an alternative to grading as it is a way of deferring grading as long as possible, I’m not sure I’m totally sold on the practice. Not yet, anyway. If a university ultimately requires instructors to assign letter grades, I’m not sure contract grading can do much to mitigate the problems associated with that.

(At the very least, I definitely agree with Ira Shor when he says that it doesn't really make sense to call it a "contract" if it's unilateral and non-negotiable. Who are we, as teachers, to tell students which grading schemes are in their best interest without consulting them first? Who are we to tell them what should count as valid and invalid sources of motivation?)

Unavoidable institutional mandates aside, though, here are some other potential problems and pitfalls:

**1 —**
In Matthew Abraham’s [“Rhetoric and Composition’s Conceptual Indeterminacy as Political-Economic Work](http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0681-sep2016/CCC0681Rhetoric.pdf),” he suggests it’s important for the field of rhetoric and composition to devise some kind of credentialing apparatus — something equivalent to engineers’ FE and PE exams, lawyers’ bar exams, or accountants’ CPA exams — something to help certify demonstrable competence and expertise (thereby helping, indirectly, consolidate disciplinary legitimacy).

I can’t help but wonder if there’s a chance that, at least at the graduate level, labor-based contract grading (with its emphasis on quantity over quality) might undermine disciplinary legitimacy by perpetuating a culture — or, at the very least, a _perceived_ culture — of laissez-faire permissiveness.

**2 —**
Of course, just because work doesn’t get graded doesn’t mean we don’t get extensive, ongoing feedback. We do.

Feedback is, I’d argue — regardless of the form it takes — inherently evaluative. For example, in an early course assignment, I proposed “exceed[ing] this course’s default grade expectations [a B] by performing additional labor via the ‘going public’ option [which you’re reading now!], thereby increasing my chances of earning an A.”

I received the following reply from the course instructor: “Excellent. I find this to be feasible and highly useful. The how of going public is less well articulated. What I would like to know is what platform or medium you will use to go public and if you plan to post videos, blogs, or something else.”

This kind of comment both validates my proposal and offers constructive (i.e., evaluative) feedback about how to proceed in a way that will best position me to fulfill course requirements. Evaluative feedback is, it seems, both (1) kind of unavoidable and (2) not inherently bad (assuming it’s fair, kind, constructive, and reasonable).

Do such claims contrast at all with Asao Inoue’s perspective? Hard to tell. For him, the central question is whether or not instructors’ judgments about quality should be factored into final grades, not whether or not such judgments should be withheld entirely (which, as I suggest, wouldn’t even be possible). In his book, Inoue says that he “calculates final course grades purely by the labor students complete, not by any judgments of the quality of their writing. While the qualities of student writing is still at the center of the classroom and feedback, it has no bearing on the course grade. Why take our judgments of quality out of the tabulation of course grades and progress in a course? Because all grading and assessment exist within systems that uphold singular, dominant standards that are racist, and White supremacist when used uniformly.”

I need to read more about this; I’m pretty ignorant about it all, right now. At this point, I just wonder: if it’s racist for final grades to reflect an instructor’s judgments about quality, why isn’t it also racist for other forms of feedback to reflect an instructor’s judgments about quality? Hm.

Here’s an excerpt from E597’s grading contract:

>Consider two issues around grades. First, using conventional classroom grading of essays and other work to compute course grades often leads students to think more about acquiring grades than about their writing or learning; to worry more about pleasing a teacher or fooling one than about figuring out what they really want to learn, or how they want to communicate something to someone for some purpose.

I wonder, though, if students are always the best judges of what they need (or even want) to learn. At least in my case, I know that much of what I’m interested in now I hadn’t even heard of three-ish years ago. Luckily, I had some experienced professors who stipulated what would be read and written about, thereby introducing me to things I didn’t know I wanted to learn about. (In the courses I teach, I do try to assign semi-open-ended writing assignments, hoping to give students enough flexibility to write about something they’re invested in. Not all students like these kinds of assignments, though. Some prefer, and do sometimes benefit from, more structured guidance.)

Plus, just because a student isn’t getting a grade from a teacher doesn’t mean the student magically stops caring what their teacher thinks. Grade or no grade, it’s human nature to fret over how someone’s going to respond to what we say and do, in writing or in person. Isn’t that as it should be? Isn’t that, moreover, a basic principle of rhetorical theory (and of empathetic communication generally) — that what we say and write should always be calibrated according to an audience’s perceived wants, needs, values, beliefs, expectations?

And yet, there’s this excerpt from Alfie Kohn’s [“The Case Against Grades”](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/):

>Extrinsic motivation, which includes a desire to get better grades, is not only different from, but often undermines, intrinsic motivation, a desire to learn for its own sake . . . Many assessment specialists talk about motivation as though it were a single entity—and their recommended practices just put a finer gloss on a system of rewards and punishments that leads students to chase marks and become less interested in the learning itself. If nourishing their desire to learn is a primary goal for us, then grading is problematic by its very nature.

Reactions to this Kohn fellow:

**REACTION 1**


. . . IS my primary goal to nourish my students’ desires to learn “for its own sake”? I’m not sure it is. Why is learning “for its own sake” valuable? I’ve thought about that . . . and I’m not actually sure what that means. What good does it do to know something that’s neither useful nor practical, that has no potential to be somehow applied in everyday life? (Even if all you’re doing is drawing on what you know in an attempt to be a semi-interesting conversation partner, that knowledge is being _used_ for something: it eases social interaction, helps create social bonds, etc.)

If anything, I think I’d want my students to _avoid_ learning for its own sake, since that would mean they’re just wasting their time. (Granted: sometimes it’s hard to predict if or when something will be useful, and sometimes it’s wise to learn as much as possible — about how to give CPR, for example — just in case. Still: that sort of knowledge isn’t valuable independent of a world where people have heart attacks . . . meaning it’s still not valuable “for its own sake.” It’s valuable because it’s at least _potentially_ useful.)

I’m reminded here of Sherlock Holmes. His assistant, John Watson, was shocked to discover that Holmes neither knew nor cared whether the Earth revolved around the sun, or whether it was the other way around. There was, for Holmes, no reason to know. It was knowledge with no practical value, no bearing on his work. It would just take up space in his mental attic, he said, crowding out other, more useful, more necessary bits of information.

I’m also reminded here of what Neil Postman, in _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, said about how being inundated on a daily basis with so much useless information means we have to invent contexts in which such information is useful:

>In a peculiar way, the photograph was the perfect complement to the flood of telegraphic news from nowhere that threatened to submerge readers in a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces. For the photograph gave a concrete reality to the strange-sounding datelines, and attached faces to the unknown names. Thus it provided the illusion, at least, that ‘the news’ had a connection to something within one's sensory experience. It created an apparent context for the 'news of the day.' And the ‘news of the day’ created a context for the photograph. But the sense of context created by the partnership of photograph and headline was, of course, entirely illusory. You may get a better sense of what I mean here if you imagine a stranger's informing you that the illyx is a subspecies of vero miform plant with articulated leaves that flowers biannually on the island of Aldononjes. And if you wonder aloud, ‘Yes, but what has that to do with anything’ imagine that your informant replies, ‘But here is a photograph I want you to see,’ and hands you a picture labeled Illyx on Aldononjes. ‘Ah, yes,’ you might murmur, ‘now I see.’

>It is true enough that the photograph provides a context for the sentence you have been given, and that the sentence provides a context of sorts for the photograph, and you may even believe for a day or so that you have learned something. But if the event is entirely self-contained, devoid of any relationship to your past knowledge or future plans, if that is the beginning and end of your encounter with the stranger, then the appearance of context provided by the conjunction of sentence and image is illusory, and so is the impression of meaning attached to it. You will, in fact, have ‘learned’ nothing (except perhaps to avoid strangers with photographs), and the illyx will fade from your mental landscape as though it had never been. At best you are left with an amusing bit of trivia, good for trading in cocktail party chatter or solving a crossword puzzle, but nothing more.

>It may be of some interest to note, in this connection, that the crossword puzzle became a popular form of diversion in America at just that point when the telegraph and the photograph had achieved the transformation of news from functional information to decontextualized fact. This coincidence suggests that the new technologies had turned the age-old problem of information on its head: Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context; the cocktail party is another; the radio quiz shows of the 1930s and 1940s and the modern television game show are still others; and the ultimate, perhaps, is the wildly successful ‘Trivial Pursuit.’

Indeed, how much does my knowledge of, say, the French yellow vest movement (which is minimal, but also not zero; it’s on my radar) affect how I conduct my daily life? Not an iota. Were there better ways to spend my time than reading about it? Undoubtedly.

**REACTION 2**

I’m not convinced “intrinsic motivation” is even a thing. (Maybe the intrinsic/extrinsic binary is another way of expressing the wants/needs binary? Still: wants and needs aren’t all that separable. I _need_ to eat to survive; I _want_ food that tastes good. I _need_ a job to afford food; I _want_ a job that’s challenging and rewarding. I _need_ to pass this class; I _want_ to get better at writing stuff that people, including instructors, like reading. It’s all connected. No desire exists independently of our desire to be liked, rewarded, valued, and validated by others.)

Anyway: I’m pretty sure _all_ motivations are extrinsic. What this means is that not only are grades not the only extrinsic motivators, they’re also not the most significant ones.

Case in point: at this time of the semester, I have exactly zero intrinsic motivation. I’ve been spending so much time writing and revising final course projects, by this point, that I'm pretty tired of them. If it were totally up to me, I’d put it all aside and not come back to it till February, when I could look at it with semi-fresh eyes. And yet . . . it’s not totally up to me (and it probably shouldn’t be), because my motivation to pass the course overrides my motivation to take a three-week, energy-restoring nap.

Basically what it comes down to is this: if I don’t pass my courses, I won’t be in “good academic standing,” which I need to maintain if I want to keep my GTA appointment. The main reason I’m revising my final projects right now, in other words, is because I don’t want to lose my job. 

This is just one more example of the precarious position graduate instructors find themselves in. It’s kind of funny, really. In some ways, grades matter less than ever, since I’m a PhD student and will probably never have to send my transcripts to anyone again, meaning there’s no real material difference between getting an A or a B. At the same time, however, grades matter more than ever: my employment status rests on them. Talk about external pressure!

**4 —**
I know this blog post is probably way longer than it has any right to be, but that’s partly because I’m a little worried about whether the “additional” labor I’m doing to try to earn an A is adequate… which brings me to my final concern: the (in)visibility of labor.

Something I do really appreciate about labor-based contract grading is the way it creates opportunities for making visible the “labor” (or time, effort, energy, processes, whatever we want to call it) that too often goes unseen, and therefore undervalued, along with the way it seeks to acknowledge and value writing and research processes over the final product (which is never really “final,” only abandoned once it serves its purpose). (Valuing the process over the product is consistent with a central principle of Cultural Studies, which English studies is more and more closely resembling: namely, that texts are not autonomous or self-sufficient, but a form of social practice.)

At the same time, aren’t concision and efficiency often considered writerly virtues? If so, isn’t a “labor-based” approach antithetical to this “less is more” attitude?

At the very least, the approach can lead to some mixed messages. Worried about whether or not the labor I was putting into my final project would be considered sufficient or comprehensive enough, I gave myself permission, in some sections, to be a little meandering, a little digressive . . . Which could easily be misinterpreted as trying to show off, or something. Indeed, this slightly digressive section earned this comment: “excessive.”

This, as you might imagine, left me slightly confused. Hey, wait a minute! I thought. Isn't the whole class structured around the idea that the more labor, the better? The difference between a B and an A, after all, is whether or not students perform “additional labor.” In that context, isn't “excess” just evidence of my labor? Of a desire to be thorough? (The reality, after all, was that I was a little paranoid about whether or not the labor I was demonstrating was adequate...)

The problem, of course, is that more _isn’t_ always better. I think it was Annie Dillard who counseled: “Write as if your audience consists solely of terminal patients. That is, after all, the case.” The clock’s ticking for all of us, and writers who respect their readers don’t waste those readers’ time. I don't want to sound salty: if my writing comes across as “excessive,” I must not be respecting my reader as much as I thought I was, and it’s certainly important to have that pointed out.

It's just a bit curious how efforts to make labor visible are only selectively rewarded. This creates some confusion, is all. And it prompts me to wonder: How do you make visible the labor that goes into making something _shorter_? Especially if teachers never see the longer version?

(Also unclear: What’s the best way to _measure_ the labor that does get made visible? My METRICS section at the very beginning is meant to suggest that comprehensive, accurate visibility might not be possible. Furthermore, just because two students both write, say, ten-page papers doesn’t mean they spent the same amount of time and energy doing so . . . )

The fiction writer George Saunders says that he keeps roughly 25 of every 100 words he writes. We have that in common (and that’s about it, unfortunately). Not only that, but much of what I write, I wouldn’t force my worst enemy to read.

The point here is this: not only is it impossible to make certain kinds of labor visible, there’s also certain labor I definitely don’t WANT to be made visible. But this of course creates problems when labor is the only basis on which grades are assigned.

Lastly: if there’s one thing we can learn from time-tracking apps like Toggl, it’s that tracking time _takes time_. Meaning that, in some ways, the visibility of certain labor is endlessly deferred: I’ll compose a “labor reflection” to make certain labor visible . . . but reflecting on labor is also, of course, a form of labor, meaning the labor reflection really should be accompanied by _its own_ labor reflection, too . . . and so on forever.

This whole blog post, in fact, began as a labor reflection. I started out just wanting to say, “Hey, I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out how this fancy GitHub blog platform works — how to write using [“GitHub Flavored Markdown”](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax, etc. — and I just wanted to document that labor, since I know we’re supposed to do that . . . “

Which then made me think: “It’s kind of a bummer that, along with all the time I spent trying to figure out how this blog platform works, I have to spend _even more_ time writing about the time I spent doing that . . . ”

Which then made me think: “Hm, I wonder if labor-based contract grading really is a preferable alternative to traditional grading regimes . . . ”

Then . . . well, one thing led to another, and I ended up wasting a bunch of time writing this blog post — not because I was “intrinsically motivated” to do so, or because I feel there’s a giant difference between getting an A and getting a B, but mainly because writing all this down is the best way to get myself to stop thinking about (read: agonizing over) it.

And also because I think it’s important for teachers to consider the possibility that an undertheorized alternative grading scheme can potentially do more harm than good — especially if it leads students like me to compose excessive blog posts in an attempt to resolve what might turn out to be unresolvable contradictions.

**TANGENTIAL POSTSCRIPT**
 
Will this post come back to bite me? What if, five-ish years from now, I find myself applying for a job at a program where a prominent contract grading theorist works? Am I shooting myself in the foot by attaching my name to a post like this?

These concerns parallel related concerns about asking my own students to compose publicly accessible e-portfolios. “Who’s going to see this?” I ask them. We spend a little time talking through the probable and intended audiences for their blogs: me, the UA Writing Program, the students themselves, maybe a grandparent they want to impress. But we also spend some time talking through the _possible_ audiences. At this point, when I ask, “Who else will be able to see this?” I’m fishing for a specific answer. If no one offers it, I do: “Literally anyone in the world with an internet connection,” I say.

I’d argue that instructors like me who mandate publicly accessible work — from periodic, informal blog posts to Adobe Spark-based e-portfolios — have an ethical duty to make this fact clear to students. Oftentimes, students are comfortable sharing things about themselves — political and religious views, various identity-based allegiances, etc. — with their instructor and others in the class that they don’t necessarily want to broadcast to the whole world. Of course, there’s no reason they _should_ be judged or discriminated against by, say, a prospective employer who Googles their names four years from now. Unfortunately, that’s a possibility — one they should be be made aware of.
