**ABOUT THE PERSON RUNNING THIS SITE**

HIS NAME = Stephen Paur

HIS AGE = 28

THINGS HE DOES = teaches in the University of Arizona Writing Program in Tucson, AZ; studies in UA's PhD program in Rhetoric, Composition, and the Teaching of English (RCTE); makes movies; draws pictures; lounges on rooftops; tickles cacti; chugs caipirinhas.

**ABOUT THIS SITE**

This site is devoted to 2 things:

1. Examining how the term/concept "power" circulates in popular discourse (semi-serious stuff!)
2. Curating playfully satirical sendups of academia (self-flagellation! to keep things from getting too serious)

**HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE SECOND THING**

The following formula is an attempt to encapsulate basically all scholarly existential crises:
> As paradigm shifts in X and Y continue to force us to revamp our definitions of A and B, the debates over the appropriate meanings for R will most likely become even more heated—and, perhaps to those outside academic communities, increasingly irrelevant."

^ Based on a sentence from Derek Owens' contribution to _Keywords in Composition Studies_ (Boynton/Cook, 1996), in which X = technology, Y = culture, A = literacy, B = writing, and R = the essay.

**ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SECOND THING**

The following is from Kurt Spellmeyer's “After Theory: From Textuality to Attunement with the World” (_College English_, vol. 58, no. 8, 1996, pp. 893-913):
> Spivak's rhetoric . . . compels its readers to abandon Mahasweta's words in order to wander through the labyrinths of Foucault's, Derrida's, Volosinov's, and Lacan's. And the result is not emancipation but a forced admission on the reader's part that even when these eminent intellects make very little sense indeed, they still somehow think more usefully than the ordinary reader ever could. If there are any 'subalterns' to be found in this particular study, one of them is surely the reader, insofar as Spivak's practice of theory does to that reader what educators do to the people they have stigmatized as 'remedial.' By refashioning the character of 'literacy' itself, the practitioners of theory have learned to transform whole shoals of articulate PhDs into stammering 'illiterates.' (898)

Actually, that's not satirical, it's a direct quote. Sorry. Still pretty hilarious.

**SPECIAL BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK INTO THE COMPOSING THOUGHT PROCESS**

`Something I wrote before making this blog:`
My initial plan was to make a Tumblr blog page; I have some experience with that platform. Lately, however, I’ve been remembering that I need to stop compromising my principles so often by, among other things, being so dependent on proprietary corporate software. Basically my whole life is stored on Google Drive, for example. This is a problem. Instead of being so beholden to Tumblr, Google, Adobe, and their ilk, I’d like to find some open-source, non-proprietary software that I can use to host my little blog project.

Then I found GitHub! And here we are.
