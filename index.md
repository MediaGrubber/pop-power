**ABOUT THIS SITE**

This site is devoted to 2 things:

(1) Examining how the term/concept "power" circulates in popular discourse (semi-substantive stuff! woo!)

(2) Curating playfully satirical sendups of academia (self-flagellation! woo!)

**HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF (2)**

I hereby submit the following formula in an attempt to encapsulate basically all scholarly existential crises:

"As paradigm shifts in X and Y continue to force us to revamp our definitions of A and B, the debates over the appropriate meanings for R will most likely become even more heated—and, perhaps to those outside academic communities, increasingly irrelevant."

^ Based on a sentence from Derek Owens' contribution to _Keywords in Composition Studies_ (Boynton/Cook, 1996), in which X = technology, Y = culture, A = literacy, B = writing, and R = the essay.
