**ABOUT THIS SITE**

This site is devoted to 2 things:

1. Examining how the term/concept "power" circulates in popular discourse (semi-substantive stuff!)
2. Curating playfully satirical sendups of academia (self-flagellation!)

**HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE SECOND THING**

The following formula is an attempt to encapsulate basically all scholarly existential crises:

"As paradigm shifts in X and Y continue to force us to revamp our definitions of A and B, the debates over the appropriate meanings for R will most likely become even more heatedâ€”and, perhaps to those outside academic communities, increasingly irrelevant."

^ Based on a sentence from Derek Owens' contribution to _Keywords in Composition Studies_ (Boynton/Cook, 1996), in which X = technology, Y = culture, A = literacy, B = writing, and R = the essay.
